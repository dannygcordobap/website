### Hi there
Thanks for stopping by. I'm **Danny Cordoba**, a systems-minded engineer, builder, and founder. My weeks are split between high-scale personalization at Amazon, space-tech experiments at Translunar ESI, and thoughtful fintech tools like credit card optimization. I enjoy taking complex problems, breaking them down with a team, and turning them into dependable systems that actually help people.

### What I'm building right now
- **Amazon** – I look after the *“Keep Shopping For”* recommendation system, which serves over 250K requests per second and influences $1B+ in monthly revenue. The best parts are working closely with partner teams, mentoring newer engineers, and keeping the system fast, fair, and reliable.
- **Translunar ESI** – I’m developing autonomous relative navigation and situational awareness software using NASA’s F´ framework. That includes building early flight-ready prototypes, coordinating research partnerships, and pitching grants so we can keep experimenting.
- **One Card** – I’m shipping a React Native + FastAPI app that picks the best credit card for every purchase. It runs on a serverless AWS stack with a lightweight LLM safety net when merchant data gets messy. It’s currently built for friends and family who want the upside of rewards without the spreadsheet.

### How I think
I treat every project like my weight training: set a clear target, track the work, and adjust until the results hold up. That keeps me curious, practical, and willing to get hands-on when the details matter. Whether I’m tightening up an API or shaping a new product scope, I rely on data, shared ownership, and steady progress instead of buzzwords.

### Outside of work
Most evenings you’ll find me in the home gym shed I am renovating from the studs — wiring, insulation, climate control, the whole thing — training toward a 1000 lb powerlifting total. I unwind with DIY projects, home energy upgrades, and conversations with friends who like spreadsheets as much as I do.

### What drives me
I’m motivated by the process — setting a goal, building toward it, and learning along the way. Whether it’s software, fitness, or a DIY project, I care about the journey as much as the outcome. The steady rhythm of effort, feedback, and small wins is what keeps me moving forward.
