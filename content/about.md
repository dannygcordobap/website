### Hi there
I'm **Danny Cordoba** — a systems-minded engineer, builder, and founder. I split my time between high-scale personalization at Amazon, space-tech experimentation at Translunar ESI, and product design for fintech tools like credit card optimization. I like taking complicated, high-leverage problems and making them fast, reliable, and genuinely useful.

### What I'm building right now
- **Amazon** – leading the *“Keep Shopping For”* recommendation pipeline, which serves over 250K requests per second and influences $1B+ in monthly revenue. I own the backend systems that turn behavioral data into real-time, personalized content.
- **Translunar ESI** – developing autonomous relative navigation and situational awareness software using NASA’s F´ framework, building early flight-ready prototypes, and driving technical partnerships and grant proposals.
- **One Card** – creating a React Native + FastAPI app that picks the best credit card for every purchase. It runs on a serverless AWS stack and uses lightweight LLM logic when merchant data gets weird.

### How I think
I design my projects like I train — define the goal, measure relentlessly, and iterate until the flywheel spins on its own. I’m empirical, skeptical, and hands-on. Whether it’s building fault-tolerant APIs or refining a startup business model, I value clarity, ownership, and iteration over theory or hype.

### Outside of work
You’ll find me in my home gym shed, which I fully wired, insulated, and finished myself, training toward a 1000 lb powerlifting total. I’m also big on DIY projects, home energy efficiency, and long-term value creation — in code, hardware, or finance.

### What drives me
I’m drawn to systems that scale — whether that’s spacecraft autonomy, financial compounding, or personal growth. I like working where technical rigor meets real-world leverage, and I believe the best systems — and people — get stronger the more you use them.
