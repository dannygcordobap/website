### Career snapshots
#### Amazon - Software Engineer II - Seattle, WA (May 2025 - Present)
I lead the recommendation-generation stack that powers our *Keep Shopping For* experience. Day to day that means coordinating five engineers, keeping large-scale experiments honest, and partnering with product to land changes our customers actually notice. Recent highlights include rolling out a new behavioral signal across every surface and mentoring an intern-led refactor that shaved 25ms from ranking latency, unlocking a few ideas we’d previously shelved.

#### Amazon - Software Engineer I - Seattle, WA (Feb 2024 - Apr 2025)
Before the promotion I worked on the same personalization surfaces, learning the stack top to bottom. I ran large experiments that added roughly $400M in annual revenue, rebuilt our CDK/Lambda/S3 data compression flow so new datasets landed in an hour instead of a day, and cut latency for tens of thousands of requests per second by batching APIs the right way.

#### Translunar ESI - Co-founder & CTO - Remote (Jun 2022 - Present)
Translunar is the nights-and-weekends adventure. I’m building autonomous navigation tech for spacecraft alongside a small cross-disciplinary crew. My role spans pairing NASA's F' flight software with our vision models, maintaining a Python/Blender ray-tracing pipeline that spins up 100K+ labeled images on demand, and keeping partnerships and grant proposals moving forward.

#### Factory Wheel Warehouse - Consulting Software Engineer - Remote (Jan 2022 - Present)
I help a small e-commerce shop in New York’s Capital Region stay nimble. I started as a sales rep while finishing my degree and gradually automated the order import, PO reconciliation, and shipment tracking flows so 70% of sales now run without manual intervention. A gentle-but-firm reminder system I built also cut cancellations by 60% and late shipments by 80%.

#### Amazon - Software Engineering Intern - Seattle, WA
- **Summer 2023:** Built an alarm-driven deployment abort for Amazon's internal CI/CD platform so 200+ deployments per minute stay safe. I also made the configuration work across both of our infrastructure-as-code stacks.
- **Summer/Fall 2022:** Brought *Keep Shopping For* to desktop by adding server-side device detection in Java/Spring and created tooling so 60%+ of Amazon.com customers could have their personalized feed reconstructed in seconds for debugging.

### Education
**Western Governors University** - B.S. Computer Science (Dec 2023)
