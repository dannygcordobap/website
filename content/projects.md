### Technical Projects

#### One Card
A credit card rewards companion that helps you always swipe the best card. It looks at where you're shopping (with your permission) and matches the merchant to the optimal rewards category. When data gets messy, it falls back to a lightweight LLM classifier. Built with React Native, FastAPI, and DynamoDB, deployed on AWS CDK. It's the app I wish existed when I first started optimizing points.

#### Translunar ESI
As Co-Founder and CTO, I’m leading the development of autonomous navigation software for spacecraft using NASA’s F´ framework. Our systems fuse vision, inertial, and orbital data to enable precise relative navigation without ground control. Translunar is still early, but the goal is clear — make autonomy in deep space routine.

#### Home Lab & Networking Stack
A self-hosted ecosystem anchored by an RTX-powered workstation and a Raspberry Pi cluster running VPN, DNS, Home Assistant, and local LLM inference. I tinker with Ollama + OpenWebUI multi-agent chains, Dockerized GPU orchestration, and persistent local storage to keep workflows fast, private, and reproducible.

#### Effortless Meal Plan
A smart meal planning web app that generates balanced recipes and grocery lists based on dietary goals. It won first place at MagicHacks 2023 for practical automation and clean UX.

### Personal Builds

#### Home Gym Shed Conversion
A full interior build — electrical wiring, breaker installation, insulation, drywall, LED lighting, and climate control — designed for long-term efficiency and year-round training. Every element was self-installed and optimized for durability and space efficiency.

#### Financial Systems Modeling
Python- and spreadsheet-based simulations for tax optimization, investment growth, and real-estate IRR. These tools make long-term financial decisions empirical, measurable, and compounding — much like software systems designed for scale.

#### Fitness Data & Strength Tracking
A data-driven approach to powerlifting and body composition, built around progressive overload models, macro tracking, and measurable recovery cycles. The current goal: a 1000 lb total by May — engineered through iteration, not guesswork.
