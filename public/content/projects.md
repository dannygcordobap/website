### Technical Projects

#### One Card
A credit card rewards companion that helps you swipe the right card without thinking about it. With permission, it looks at where you're shopping and picks the category that earns the best return. When the data gets messy, a lightweight LLM classifier steps in. React Native, FastAPI, and DynamoDB on AWS CDK keep everything tidy. I originally built it for friends and family who wanted points without spreadsheets.

#### Translunar ESI
As Co-Founder and CTO, I’m building autonomous navigation software for spacecraft on top of NASA’s F´ framework. We fuse vision, inertial, and orbital data to keep vehicles aware without constant ground control. We’re still early, but each prototype gets us closer to making deep-space autonomy feel routine.

#### Home Lab & Networking Stack
A self-hosted setup anchored by an RTX workstation and a Raspberry Pi cluster running VPN, DNS, Home Assistant, and local LLM inference. I tinker with Ollama + OpenWebUI multi-agent chains, Dockerized GPU orchestration, and persistent local storage to keep workflows fast, private, and reproducible.

#### Effortless Meal Plan
A web app that turns dietary goals into balanced recipes and grocery lists. It won first place at MagicHacks 2023 for practical automation and clean UX.

### Personal Builds

#### Home Gym Shed Conversion
A full interior build — electrical wiring, breaker installation, insulation, drywall, LED lighting, and climate control — designed for long-term efficiency and year-round training. Every piece was self-installed and tuned so it stays comfortable through Seattle weather.

#### Financial Systems Modeling
Python- and spreadsheet-based simulations that help me and my wife make informed calls on tax optimization, financial planning, and home improvement projects. They keep big financial decisions grounded in data instead of guesswork.

#### Fitness Data & Strength Tracking
A data-driven approach to powerlifting built around progressive overload, macro tracking, and measurable recovery cycles. The current target is a 1000 lb total by May — steady progress, one training block at a time.
