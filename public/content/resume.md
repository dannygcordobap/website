### Career snapshots
#### Amazon - Software Engineer II - Seattle, WA (May 2025 - Present)
I'm the point person for the recommendation-generation stack. I coordinate five engineers, handle the tricky A/B testing logistics, and keep us shipping improvements that matter. Two favorites: weaving in a new behavioral signal across all surfaces, and coaching an intern-led refactor that cut our impression ranking latency by 25ms, opening up product ideas we couldn't consider before.

#### Amazon - Software Engineer I - Seattle, WA (Feb 2024 - Apr 2025)
Before leveling up, I worked on the same family of personalization features. I ran large-scale experiments that grew annual revenue by ~$400M, rebuilt a data compression and orchestration flow with CDK/Lambda/S3 so new datasets landed in an hour instead of a day, and batched API calls to trim latency for tens of thousands of requests per second.

#### Translunar ESI - Co-founder & CTO - Remote (Jun 2022 - Present)
This is my nights-and-weekends adventure: building autonomous navigation tech for satellites. I wrangle a small cross-disciplinary team, pair NASA's F' flight software with our computer vision models, and maintain a Python/Blender ray-tracing pipeline that cranks out 100K+ perfectly labeled training images whenever we get a new CAD model to simulate.

#### Factory Wheel Warehouse - Consulting Software Engineer - Remote (Jan 2022 - Present)
I help a very small e-commerce business in New York's Capital Region stay nimble. Starting there as a Sales Representative while pursuing my online degree, I automated their order importing, PO reconciliation, and shipment tracking so 70% of sales now flow without manual babysitting. I also built a gentle-but-firm reminder system that cuts cancellations by 60% and late shipments by 80%.

#### Amazon - Software Engineering Intern - Seattle, WA
- **Summer 2023:** Shipped an alarm-driven deployment abort for Amazon's internal CI/CD platform, keeping 200+ deployments per minute safe. Also made the alarm-driven pipeline configuration work across both of our infrastructure-as-code flavors.
- **Summer/Fall 2022:** Extended "Keep Shopping For" to desktop by adding server-side device detection in Java/Spring, and built tooling so 60%+ of Amazon.com customers could have their personalized feed reconstructed in seconds for debugging.

### Education
**Western Governors University** - B.S. Computer Science (Dec 2023)
Competency-based, which meant I could accelerate through the fundamentals and spend more time on the fun parts: distributed systems, software architecture, and a capstone that combined all of the above.
